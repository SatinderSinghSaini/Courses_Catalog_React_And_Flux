## Application Details

1.  This aplication Uses React as frontend framework and Flux(Facebooks's Flux) for state management.
2.  FLUX is Uni directional that means Data flows in one direction
    Action -> Dispatcher -> Store -> React -> Action -> ....
    User perform some action(action is object which consist of actionType and payload)
    dispatcher checks which stores are registered to a particular action.
    Store contains Models(Application Data) and the logic to update models. It performs actions to update store's model and emit changes.
    React Component, who subscribed to change listner of store will get to know about the changed store.
    Again React component will create action, action will be dispatched to Store, Store will perform action and updates model, store will emit change to let react components know about the change and this cycle continues.
    From above steps of flux, we can see that data flows uni directionally from Action to Dispatcher to Store to React components.

3.  api folder contains backend code which uses the express framework. We have consumed courseApi for our application.
    We don't need to focus on api folder implementation as main objective of this project is to understand the React concepts including Flux.
4.  We have used BrowserRouter for routing, bootstrap for styling and react-toastify for showing notification.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
